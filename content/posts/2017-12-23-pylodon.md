pylodon began as smilodon.social, a python flask-based website meant to interoperate primarily with mastodon.

over time, i started to understand the scope of [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks), and realized that it could be so much more than another way of using mastodon.
pylodon split from smilodon to be a standalone [ActivityPub S2S server](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#server-to-server-interactions), utilizing the [ActivityPub C2S API](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#client-to-server-interactions). at the same time, i decided to drastically change course with smilodon, and make it nothing more than a client.

my friend [Drew](https://twitter.com/hornbein), who i work with via [Good Good Work](https://goodgoodwork.io), recently got very excited about [vue.js](), so i decided to try it out for the first pylodon client, along with flask to serve it.
[smilodon](https://github.com/rowanlupton/smilodon) is in its very early stages as a flask/vue application, little more than the bare tutorial, but i see great things in its future.
