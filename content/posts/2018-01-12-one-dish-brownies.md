# y'all this is close to the worst post on this site, please check out some other things i wrote!

One oven-safe frying pan, one whisk, a third-cup measure, and a scale.
And, of course, the ingredients.

Last night, Nicki asked me to make brownies. Me being me, I hit up [Smitten Kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/), and simultaneously knew that I didn't want to clean any dishes. imagine my delight, when I realized that I could make (approximately) [\[Deb Perelman's\] Favorite Brownies](https://smittenkitchen.com/2012/08/my-favorite-brownies/) in just my carbon steel skillet!

Because we don't keep unsweetened baking chocolate lying around (although, really, we should), I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and cut back the sugar from Deb's recipe.

As far as I know this should work just fine in a well-seasoned cast iron pan, or in any other oven-safe cookware you might have. There are myriad variations; I melt the butter stovetop right on the burner, but you could always make a double boiler, or whatever else. Use your creativity.

### Ingredients
* 3 ounces (85 grams) chocolate^[chop roughly if baker's chocolate]
* 1 stick (4 ounces or 115 grams) butter
* 230g^[Deb's recipe, with unsweetened chocolate, calls for 265g] granulated sugar
* 2 eggs
* dash^[this can be a big dash, according to taste. an en- or an em-dash, if you will] vanilla extract
* some salt, according to taste
* 2/3 cup (85 grams) all-purpose flour

Pre-heat oven to 350Â°F.

Melt the butter on the stove, at mediumish heat. Choose how you do this wisely; whatever the butter touches will be with you for the rest of the recipe. When the butter is melted^[and browned, if you feel like it], add the chocolate. Once it's mostly melted, remove the pan from heat.

Whisk in sugar, then add and whisk eggs and vanilla. Add salt and flour, incorporate.

If you want to add extras (coarse sea salt, choc chips, nuts^[or, y'know, don't]), this is the time. Toss^[place] your pan in the oven, set a timer for, oh, somewhere between 25 and 30 minutes, and bake until a toothpick/knife/whatever comes out of the center clean. Or otherwise, according to your taste.

Clean a whopping one or two kitchen items. Once you've eaten the brownies, clean the pan.
