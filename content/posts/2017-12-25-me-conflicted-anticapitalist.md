most of my time is spent around anticapitalist thought. it's hard not to, in my experience of my generation — [we've been fucked over by rampant unregulated capitalism](http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/poor-millennials/), so of course we're going to push back.

at the same time, i like owning things, and i think that money is a useful tool that keeps me from having to do a whole chain of trades just to get a sandwich. this doesn't make me a capitalist, but it gives me pause around engaging in convos about money being the root of all evil. i've started calling myself a (conflicted) anticapitalist^[i want to give my usual disclaimer that other people know more about {{ blog topic }} than i do, and add that this is just as much an explanation of who i am as it is a treatise on fixing the economic system. reading back, it's definitely possible to say "asshole that's called socialism" but y'know, labels are personal, and this is what feels right to me.].

> money isn't the root of all evil. unregulated money is the root of most.

i don't think you should be allowed to have boundless amounts of it. that applies to the upper and lower ends of the scale — touches on universal basic income and aggressive taxing^[realistically, this would probably look more like a math limit, with strongly diminishing returns — so you could have a lot of money? but it would be really difficult? i don't know i am not an economist]. i do think it's necessary to have some wiggle room in the amount you have.

i see the capitalist argument that competition drives innovation. i think that aggressive taxing would allow for the possibility of gain through being better than the rest, while still making it hard for anybody to control wealth.
i think that the glaring holes in this take the form of tax loopholes and alternate forms of wealth. i don't have good answers beyond "give us something better", but god damn it. ***give us something better***

this is the part where i feel somewhat obligated to put in a plug for [coops](https://blog.rowan.website/tag/coop/).
