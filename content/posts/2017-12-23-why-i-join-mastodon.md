I've [joined Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) four times. The first was in October or November 2016, on [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social), when [@shel](https://cybre.space/@shel) first joined and told all of her friends; I stuck around for a bit, but only had two or so friends on it ([@shel](https://cybre.space/@shel) and [@ebeth](https://witches.town/@ebeth)), and I had a large social group on Twitter, so i went back to 'birdsite' (Twitter, per bits of the fediverse).

## now I'm back.

a couple of months ago, I picked [@rowanlupton@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@rowanlupton) back up^[and started working on an [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/)[implementation in Python](https://github.com/rowanlupton/pylodon)]. In the time since, I've made more of an effort to explore the fediverse^[the collection of Mastodon, gnu.social, and other interoperable servers are commonly referred to as the 'fediverse'] than I did when I first joined.

## the local and federated timelines
The things that make Mastodon feel really special are the local and federated timelines:
### local
The local timeline shows you everybody on your current instance. That is, if I look at my local timeline on toot.cafe, I'll see "toots"^[posts] from everybody with a toot.cafe username. This is the timeline that really exemplifies an instance's personality/character.
### federated
The federated timeline shows toots from everybody who the instance knows of. To continue using toot.cafe as an example, that means that I can see toots from any user who is followed by somebody on toot.cafe. That is: if I use my @rowan@toot.cafe account to follow @user@mastodon.social, everybody on toot.cafe will see toots from @user@mastodon.social on their federated timeline.
In my experience, the federated timeline tends to move too fast for me, so I just keep local open.

## instances
###[toot.cafe](https://toot.cafe)
Shortly after logging back into mastodon, I joined [toot.cafe](https://toot.cafe) because I'd heard it was a good place for web development (it is!). I made some good connections there, including [@cwebber](https://octodon.social/@cwebber), who co-wrote the ActivityPub spec, [@sivy](https://toot.cafe/@sivy), [@npd](https://octodon.social/@npd), and more, all of whom have helped me in varying ways throughout my development.
I try to keep my computery stuff on here, so that people can filter what they follow from me.

###[social.coop](https://social.coop)
Around the same time as rejoining Mastodon (I'm fuzzy on timelines) I'd started contributing with [Good Good Work](https://goodgoodwork.io). I'd been hoping to work with [Little Weaver](https://littleweaverweb.com/) for a while already, so the coop idea wasn't new to me, but I'm still surprised how quickly I caught the coop bug^["wait, but, surely \[insert thing\] should be a coop too?!"]. I've had a great time reading people's  thoughts on coops and anticapitalism and met [@ntnsndr](https://social.coop/@ntnsndr)^[a friend of Good Good Work].
This is the instance where I'm the least active, but when I start figuring out coops enough to have more feelings about them, you can bet this is where I'll be.
[I wrote a blog post about how I think that social.coop captures the spirit of mastodon](https://blog.rowan.website/2017/12/24/mastodon-and-coops/)

###[cybre.space](https://cybre.space)
With each instance that I've joined, I've found a new community of people. On toot.cafe and social.coop, they have had specific shared interests â€” web development and cooperative businesses.
Cybre.space is different. Here, the community^[local timeline] is curated by common philosophies/ways of being. It feels much easier to make real friends here than on the other instances; less like a tool, and more like a social group.
My account on cybre.space is set to private by default, because it's my most personal space.

## wrap-up
Mastodon is a special place to me. It looks a bit like Twitter, but the character is completely different; because of small design decisions like "not showing post likes by default" it becomes less of a popularity contest, in favor of being about the people.
Mastodon, besides the technical excitement of federation, is, truly, a social network for humans.

<small>you can follow me on the fediverse on [toot.cafe](https://toot.cafe/@rowan), [social.coop](https://social.coop/@rowan), and/or [cybre.space](https://cybre.space/@rowan).</small>
