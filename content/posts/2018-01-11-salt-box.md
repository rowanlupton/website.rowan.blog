For a couple of years now, I've been considering something. As anybody who knows me can attest, I have, and share, a lot of opinions. Hell, I self-host a fucking blog.

In an effort to be a more likable person and have more friends, I've considered making a box. I would put a hole in the top of the box, label it "salt", and carry around bits of paper and a pencil/pen.

Then at the end of the year, I would open it up, and send each paper to a random friend/acquaintance. This bit is optional, and relies on the complaints being written in a sufficiently contextless way that I wouldn't be making an ass of myself â€” e.g. instead of writing "Adina Gordon should learn the difference between 'gate' and 'cast'", I would write, "gate and cast mean different things"^[but i wouldn't, because I love Adina very much and this isn't an actual criticism].

Since I don't like carrying around large things that aren't my computer, today I considered starting a new twitter or mastodon account. It would be locked, and I would tweet contextless complaints to it, instead of saying them out loud. I might make a request form to follow it. I predict, oh, five or so people would be interested.

Would you?
