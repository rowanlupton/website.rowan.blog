## *or: why social.coop gets it right*
[<small>i write more about my relationship with mastodon here</small>](https://blog.rowan.website/2017/12/23/why-i-join-mastodon/)

i am sure i'm not the first to write about how there's a direct link between the federated social web and cooperative business ideologies.
there's a clear line to be drawn between the idea of a social network run and participated in by the people who own it, with each instance working together to create a bigger and better network, and a business run and participated in etc.

[social.coop](https://social.coop) is, obviously, a manifestation of this confluence. a platform coop-run instance of mastodon, they substitute loomio for the github issues tracker that mastodon development uses, and their wiki is about the instance rather than the software — but in many ways, abstractly, it's the same thing.

[Good Good Work](https://goodgoodwork.io) talks about a future where we're not a design and technology coop, but rather, a network of all different types of coops. we talk about having a pod^[a self-governing group within the overarching Good Good Work coop] in denver, and one in the northeast, and a traveling one, all working together to build a better future — and there's no reason why the pods have to work on the web, or even technology. it's a huge vision of a big network inside of a bigger network of coops, and by now, you should be able to see where this is going.

mastodon is not a cooperative business, and there are instances that are specifically capitalist^[my cooperative mindset is [(conflictedly) anticapitalist](https://blog.rowan.website/2017/12/25/me-conflicted-anticapitalist/); i realize that not everybody's is] ([capitalism.party](https://capitalism.party/about) comes to mind), but that doesn't mean that mastodon is not cooperative. how can you not be, when your whole point is to federate.
