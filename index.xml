      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the contra scene since I was born; my parents met at a contra dance, and their main social community is based off of it, so it was kind of unavoidable.</description>

      <description>GOT THE BLOG BACK

      <description>As expected, when I started writing on a standalone blog instead of long facebook posts, interaction with things I said dropped.
This is frustrating.
I think that I&amp;rsquo;m saying better things than I was in long unedited Facebook posts.</description>

      <description>I hate self-promotion. It feels gross, and it feels like I should be letting people come to me, and it feels like a huge imposition on all of my friends.</description>

      <description>The Morris Ring. An organization that&amp;rsquo;s been irrelevant to any non-morris dancer, largely irrelevant to any side in the United States, and irrelevant to many dancers in the U.</description>

      <description>alright. friends.
i&amp;rsquo;ve stayed publicly silent on this great debate for long enough. i can&amp;rsquo;t in good conscience stay silent any longer. i will warn you, though, my views may not match the black and white painting of the issue that you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with.</description>

      <title>why I join Mastodon</title>
      <link>https://blog.rowan.website/posts/2017-12-23-why-i-join-mastodon/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.rowan.website/posts/2017-12-23-why-i-join-mastodon/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve joined Mastodon four times. The first was in October or November 2016, on mastodon.social, when @shel first joined and told all of her friends; I stuck around for a bit, but only had two or so friends on it (@shel and @ebeth), and I had a large social group on Twitter, so i went back to &amp;lsquo;birdsite&amp;rsquo; (Twitter, per bits of the fediverse).</description>

      <description>first off: mastodon is amazing and i&amp;rsquo;m so impressed by @gargon&amp;rsquo;s tenacity and brilliance in bringing it to life
that being said, the biggest weakness that i see with mastodon is how intertwined the frontend and backend are.</description>

      <description>The situation: you&amp;rsquo;ve seen people talking about Mastodon. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re intrigued, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re not. Either way, when they&amp;rsquo;ve tried to explain it to you, you&amp;rsquo;ve been confused, turned off, or maybe even a little angry that they won&amp;rsquo;t shut up about it.</description>
