    <h1>Self-promotion</h1>
    <p><p>I hate self-promotion. It feels gross, and it feels like I should be letting people come to me, and it feels like a huge imposition on all of my friends.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s no way that I&rsquo;m going to be financially successful<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:without-getting"><a href="#fn:without-getting">1</a></sup> without telling people that I&rsquo;m good at things, and that they should hire me. So I&rsquo;ve been working on it.</p>

<p>It still feels crass. It feels like I&rsquo;m taking advantage of my friends&rsquo; willingness to keep me in their lists, and I always assume that some people I care about have unfollowed my feed on Facebook.</p>

<p>To try and combat this, I&rsquo;ve made a couple of Facebook pages — <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rowanluptonblog/">one for this blog</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Living-Tradition-Sound-Lighting-148030765914408/">one for my sound/lighting self</a>. Some intrepid folks have liked them, but definitely not enough to make a meaningful impact<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:apart-from-feeli"><a href="#fn:apart-from-feeli">2</a></sup>. I&rsquo;m still not sure that a still-bootstrapping sound and lighting outfit is an appropriate entity to have a facebook page — very few people pay attention to who&rsquo;s doing sound, and I don&rsquo;t know of anybody who goes to events because of the technical crew (unless they have a personal connection).</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m not sure what to do. I meant to stop crossposting blog posts to my main Facebook, but my blog page doesn&rsquo;t have a large audience. I have a page sitting around that says Living Tradition Sound &amp; Lighting, but no use for it, no content to publish, and no reviews.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Of course, I&rsquo;ve also been working at getting gigs in the more personal way — I schmooze with friends, network at every gig I have, and have taken up cold-emailing event planners and venues asking them if they need an engineer. I&rsquo;ve got a few gigs this day, but nowhere near enough to feel comfortable. I can survive off of income from <a href="https://goodgoodwork.io">Good Good Work</a>, but not comfortably.</p>

<p>Freelancing is hard, and it sucks, and I don&rsquo;t recommend it. Alleviate my pain: <a href="http://livingtradition.tech">hire me to do sound and/or lights.</a></p>
