    <h1>youth trad song weekend 2018</h1>
    <p><p>another yts, come and gone.</p>

<p>i remember at the first couple of yts weekends, i went to workshops and led songs and generally participated a ton. contrast to the past couple of years, when i&rsquo;ve mostly done sound, played games, sang some daily book, and joined in a song circle or two.</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m of two minds about all of this. am i wasting my money, and taking a space that somebody else could have, who would more fully enjoy the programming of the weekend? i love yts, or i wouldn&rsquo;t go; it&rsquo;s a fantastic concentration of my friends, a welcome respite from the winter<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:the-weekend-not"><a href="#fn:the-weekend-not">1</a></sup>, and i really do love being around singing.</p>

<p>i&rsquo;ve also got the protection of doing sound for the event. i provide an important service, that nobody else does — my presence would help the weekend to function, even if i sat in my room all the time i wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>

<p>angst about taking space aside, yts 2018 was as delightful as usual. i was apprehensive going in, having had nicki&rsquo;s and my family in town for a few days around new year&rsquo;s, but once i arrived and got settled i felt right at home<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:this-always-happ"><a href="#fn:this-always-happ">2</a></sup>. i hung out with people i only rarely see, listened to people loving music and their voices, played games. went to sleep early friday night<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:by-which-i-mean"><a href="#fn:by-which-i-mean">3</a></sup>, an increasingly common for me good choice.</p>

<p>i didn&rsquo;t dance an irish set in the bathroom, for the first time in a few years. it may not have happened; when sam tried to rally a crowd, most of the likely suspects were feeling burnt out from the earlier set of Mon(e)y( )[M/m]usk in the men&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>open mic was closer to an enjoyable experience than i remember it being, apart from its tremendous length. i can&rsquo;t speak to whether that stems from the acts being better curated, people being more mindful about submitting acts, chance, or me being more open to it. i&rsquo;d guess chance.</p>

<p>the immediately-following contra dance, <a href="https://blog.rowan.website/2018/01/08/yts-2k18-sound/">while a bit stressful from a sound point of view</a>, was a huge success; while the dancing is never outstanding at yts, the spirit and community are. the lack of pretense, and openness to people going up on stage, serves as a refresher from serious contra dancing for serious people<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:not-an-indictmen"><a href="#fn:not-an-indictmen">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>whisk(e)y<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:you-pretentious"><a href="#fn:you-pretentious">5</a></sup> followed, along with the only public baby screams of the weekend<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:i-hear-he-was-up"><a href="#fn:i-hear-he-was-up">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>sunday morning: more games. lunch. Feelings Sing™ happened to align with my cleaning up sound equipment. roads home were clear, and i didn&rsquo;t once fear for my traction, unlike the way there. ended the day celebrating nicole&rsquo;s birthday at her apartment, with an assortment of weekend attendees and others.</p>
