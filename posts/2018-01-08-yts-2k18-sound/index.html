    <h1>yts 2k18 - sound</h1>
    <p>

<p>jesus fuckin christ y&rsquo;all i was so stressed on friday</p>

<p>important note: i don&rsquo;t wish to cast any blame or aspersions on the yts committee. they do a fantastic job running a huge weekend, everything worked out, and everybody had a great time.</p>

<p>months before yts, the committee and i were in touch about sound, compensation, etc. i mentioned in an email about this that i&rsquo;d be happy to provide sound equipment, and nothing more was said.</p>

<p>i never followed up on it; neither did the committee. we&rsquo;ve both marked it down to be more careful of in the future.</p>

<p>on friday, i went to my workspace and picked up the speakers i bought secondhand this summer — a B-52 matrix set, two mains run off of a subwoofer. that&rsquo;s right: because i don&rsquo;t own an independent amplifier, i brought a sub to yts.</p>

<p>before we go any further, it seems educational to include a list of equipment i own.</p>

<ul>
<li>mackie dl1608 (and accompanying ipad)</li>
<li>2 B-52 main speakers</li>
<li>2 speaker stands (crappy and feel unsafe)</li>
<li>1 B-52 subwoofer/amplifier/crossover</li>
<li>7 standard XLR cables (one is highly questionable)</li>
<li>2 neutrik switched XLR cables (one is about a foot long)</li>
<li>2 Blue Encore 300 microphones (both crackle, and are out of rotation until they don&rsquo;t)</li>
<li>2 LYXpro pencil condensers (these cost $70 but do the job okay, for now)</li>
<li>1 clip microphone arm (has a c-clamp on one end)</li>
<li>0 mic stands</li>
</ul>

<p>this should give you an idea of why i was so nervous about the weekend. i don&rsquo;t own a complete sound system, but had to provide sound for a host of campers who aren&rsquo;t used to microphones and run a contra dance saturday night.</p>

<h2 id="first-night">first night</h2>

<p>the first night was fine. the committee held the mic, i had the amp a bit low but was able to compensate on the mixer, nobody died. success!</p>

<h2 id="open-mic">open mic</h2>

<p>i borrowed a mic stand from the silent auction. it has a second boom attachment, which meant that i was all set for acts involving instruments like guitars.
i used an omnidirectional cap for the vocal mic because i knew that there were some acts that consisted of multiple singers. this involved some aggressive ringing out of the room, but there wasn&rsquo;t any feedback and everybody sounded through, except the people who stood Very Far Apart. nobody died.</p>

<h2 id="contra-dance">contra dance</h2>

<p>up front: nobody died
as is at this point traditional at yts, after the open mic on saturday night there was a contra dance to an open band. three musicians (flute, fiddle, fiddle) had clip-ons, we used julie&rsquo;s keyboard, and i rigged up a second mic stand<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:spare-speaker-st"><a href="#fn:spare-speaker-st">1</a></sup> for a cello.</p>

<p>harder bit: monitors.
an important piece of information, at this point, is how the B-52s are set up. (actually this might be about what you&rsquo;d expect, but if it is, bear with me)
<img src="/content/images/2018/01/Matrix1000V2Amplifier.jpg" alt="Matrix1000V2Amplifier" />
you&rsquo;ll see that there are individual channels for the left and right speaker, gain dials for each speaker and the subwoofer, pre-gain pass-throughs, and speak-on outputs.
standard stuff. the problem is, both channels feed to the subwoofer, so i had to high-pass the monitor to avoid doubling up my bass.</p>

<p>my monitor. obviously, the only option here was to use one of the two speakers as a monitor — the musicans need to hear the piano, after all. i fed the right channel from aux 1, put the speaker near the piano, and it filled the stage. loud, muddy in the hall, but effective enough for a 1.5hr pickup contra dance. success. nobody died.</p>

<h2 id="the-mic-stand">the mic stand</h2>

<p>to finish off my account of sound from the weekend: i now own a mic stand, with a second boom attachment, that i got from the auction for $15. i&rsquo;m looking forward to a less-stressful next sound gig.</p>
